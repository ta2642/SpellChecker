This is an implementation of a custom spell-checker. 
It takes in a filename and can return a list of all incorrect words through method getIncorrectWords().
It can also provide suggestions for the incorrectly spelled words via method getSuggestions().

It does so by using a reference dictionary (words.txt).
It parses the dictionary and stores the words in a HashSet.
